# terraform-provider-keboola

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) Custom Provider for [Keboola Connection (KBC)](https://www.keboola.com).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plmwong/terraform-provider-keboola.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/plmwong/terraform-provider-keboola)

## Description

This is a custom terraform provider for managing common resources within the Keboola Connection (KBC) platform, such as Transformations, Orchestrations, Writers etc.

## Supported Resources

Currently, the following KBC resources are supported (or partially supported) for configuration via `terraform`:

* `keboola_access_token`
* `keboola_csvimport_extractor`
* `keboola_ftp_extractor`
* `keboola_ftp_extractor_file`
* `keboola_gooddata_user_management`
* `keboola_gooddata_user_management_v2`
* `keboola_gooddata_writer`
* `keboola_gooddata_writer_v3`
* `keboola_orchestration`
* `keboola_orchestration_tasks`
* `keboola_postgresql_writer`
* `keboola_postgresql_writer_tables`
* `keboola_snowflake_extractor`
* `keboola_snowflake_extractor_tables`
* `keboola_snowflake_writer`
* `keboola_snowflake_writer_tables`
* `keboola_storage_bucket`
* `keboola_storage_table`
* `keboola_transformation_bucket`
* `keboola_transformation`

## Requirements

* [hashicorp/terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)

## Singular vs. Plural

Some resources (e.g. `keboola_gooddata_writer_table`, `keboola_storage_bucket`) are configured as singular resources, while others (e.g. `keboola_snowflake_writer_tables`, `keboola_orchestration_tasks`) are plural. This is a design decision in order for
the terraform resources to closely match how they are managed through the Keboola API(s).

Resources that are plural are managed through the API in a single call that will create/update/delete all of them at once.
Resources that are singular can be created/updated/deleted independently of one another in separate API calls, and so are modelled as such.

## Usage

### Provider Configuration

The provider only requires a single configuration setting `api_key`. Make sure that the access token you use has the required permissions
for the resources that you wish to manage.

#### `keboola`

```
provider "keboola" {
  api_key     =   "${var.storage_api_key}"
}
```

### Resource Configuration

For documentation on each supported resource, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/plmwong/terraform-provider-keboola/wiki).

## Contributing

Bug reports, suggestions, code additions/changes etc. are very welcome! When making code changes, please branch off of `master` and then raise a pull request so it can be reviewed and merged.

### Running Acceptance Tests

The `terraform-provider-keboola` resources will have Terraform acceptance tests, which are run against a real Keboola project to test resource creation, update and deletion. At a minimum, all of these tests must pass on the `master` branch for any release candidate.

To run the Acceptance tests locally, you will need to have access to your own (preferably empty) Keboola project, and also have created an access token for accessing that project. This token should be for a user who has full access to create/update/delete anything on the project.

To enable acceptance tests, set the `TF_ACC` environment variable to `1`, and set the `STORAGE_API_KEY` environment variable to the access token for the project.

Then run the tests by running `make test`.
